Lebron walks into a secret bunker. Non-perishable food and water is stacked against the walls. Upon further investigation, Lebron sees two additional exits to the bunker. He thinks to himself that this is not a very good bunker, having so many exits. The two exits are both doors, one wooden, one steel. He enjoys some food and water while he thinks about which door material he likes better.
